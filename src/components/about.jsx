        <p>
          Hey, I'm Yash, a full-stack developer and designer. I love building
          things that people genuinely use and love, not just for showcases
          (like the typical engineer). Besides programming, I love F1 &
          football. I also enjoy reading books in my free time. If you have an
          idea and would like to collaborate, feel free to DM me! I'm always
          open and ready to connect and work on exciting projects.
          Iâ€™m Mia Carter, a curious designer, coder, and storyteller. Currently a
          student at Springfield High School, but always exploring the limitless
          possibilities of creativity and technology. I thrive on transforming
          ideas into reality, whether it's crafting digital interfaces,
          designing immersive visuals, or building websites that feel effortless
          to use.
